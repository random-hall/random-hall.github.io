You must be tired from your journey (up four [ok, it's really three] flights of stairs). Have a rest whispering answers to the NYT crossword and spelling bee, pondering nonsensical philosophical questions, pondering sensical pragmatic questions, or listening to steampunk weirdcore complex vampire tunes on our beloved sound system. Enjoy the cadence and cuisine of over 9.81 languages and cultures, and contribute your own!</p><p>We like to party in many ways. If you're feeling like venturing out into the world of ocean voyages, fairy carnivals, and reckless bears, participate in one of our several ongoing D&D or other TTRPG campaigns. If, instead, you wish to strut your stuff at a late-night gathering filled with late 2010's music, perhaps in costume on Halloween or not in costume on not Halloween, you will find a place here. We contain multitudes.</p><p>Come, friend, and flourish. For it's always morning on bonfire. </p></section><section class="one-info" id="pecker"><h2 class="section-header">Pecker</h2><p>Random Hall Bakery; as a side effect it houses twelve residents and the GRA of Pecker, Bonfire, and Clam.</p><p>Recipe for Pecker, aka Random Hall Bakery:</p><p>Ingredients:</p><ul><li>50 lbs of rice</li><li>50 lbs of flour</li><li>50 lbs of sugar</li><li>6 dozen eggs</li><li>57 Christmas Island crabs</li><li>42 board games</li><li>4 slay the spire characters</li><li>7 crosswords (per week)</li><li>17 fans</li><li>0.5 IPA chart</li><li>1 top (optional)</li><li>1 tbsp of communism</li><li>a dash of spite</li></ul><p>Instructions:</p><ol><li>preheat the oven to 350F.</li><li>pet the cats.</li><li>mix all ingredients together.</li><li>chat with the GRA of Pecker, Clam, and Bonfire (PCB).</li><li>pour into a baking dish</li><li>bake for 47 minutes!</li></ol></section><section class="one-info" id="clam"><h2 class="section-header">Clam</h2><p>The Gaymer floor of Random. It's home for a large collection of consoles, video games, and board games. Our floor is proudly loud and never sleeps. We feast on McDonald's and we still have an enormous stash of pasta to get through. Our communal fridge and cupboard is filled with ingredients and is only getting bigger! We love plushies and our lounge is filled with them. We are home to the best bathroom, with the biggest, cleanest, shinest shower. You will often find us planning the next revolution against the filthy Random Hall government.
