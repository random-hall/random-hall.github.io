  p Come home, fair traveler, rest your feet. You must be tired from your journey (up four [ok, it's really three] flights of stairs). Have a rest whispering answers to the NYT crossword and spelling bee, pondering nonsensical philosophical questions, pondering sensical pragmatic questions, or listening to steampunk weirdcore complex vampire tunes on our beloved sound system. Enjoy the cadence and cuisine of over 9.81 languages and cultures, and contribute your own!

  p We like to party in many ways. If you're feeling like venturing out into the world of ocean voyages, fairy carnivals, and reckless bears, participate in one of our several ongoing D&D or other TTRPG campaigns. If, instead, you wish to strut your stuff at a late-night gathering filled with late 2010's music, perhaps in costume on Halloween or not in costume on not Halloween, you will find a place here. We contain multitudes.

  p Come, friend, and flourish. For it's always morning on bonfire.

  h2.section-header Clam

  p The Gaymer floor of Random. It's home for a large collection of consoles, video games, and board games. Our floor is proudly loud and never sleeps. We feast on McDonald's and we still have an enormous stash of pasta to get through. Our communal fridge and cupboard is filled with ingredients and is only getting bigger! We love plushies and our lounge is filled with them. We are home to the best bathroom, with the biggest, cleanest, shinest shower. You will often find us planning the next revolution against the filthy Random Hall government. We only house fourteen soldiers but the clam lives within many others around the dorm and the MIT campus!

  p ...hey, has this happened before? Do you feel like time is repeating itself? As if you've had this same day before, and you will again, over and over and over.... 

  p Well, there's no better place to contemplate impossible spacetime geometries than Loop! We're friendly, quiet, and warm, and our kitchen is always full of camaraderie and the smells of baked goods. We're a non-male floor with a propensity for lesbianism, a fondness for physics, and a susceptibility to the siren call of the bookshelf. Come rest from the endless march of time in our kitchen and pet a cat, write a poem, and let the impossible beauty of the universe unfold around you. Why not enjoy the moment? You only get it once, after all... or do you?

  p ...hey, has this happened before?

  p welcome to black hole, the second floor of random hall on the 290 side! along with the largest number of [scream] per capita at MIT, we’re home to four mannequins, two cats, and some quantity of people.

  p bh was named for its ability to mysteriously suck anyone who walks by into whatever exciting happenings is going on on the floor, never to be seen again.

  p we’re best described as “wholesome sketchy.” with at least one bh resident awake at every hour of the day, you can generally find someone in bhitchen (black hole kitchen). they might be cooking, building, climbing, scheming, planning out an elaborate floor event, or even doing *gasp* math! maybe they’ll ask if you want to go climbing or practice spinning arts on the roofdeck.

  p Enjoyers of clean kitchens, animals, and NO QUIET HOURS! We NEVER play league of legends EVER! (editor here, they're apparently using an advanced technique called "lying" about how little they play league) We are the smallest non-small floor at 10 residents.
