  p The Gaymer floor of Random. It's home for a large collection of consoles, video games, and board games. Our floor is proudly loud and never sleeps. We feast on McDonald's and homemade pasta. Our communal fridge and cupboard is filled with ingredients and is only getting bigger! We love plushies and our lounge is filled with them. We are home to the best bathroom in Random that has been recently renovated and both of our bathrooms are equipped with bidets. You will often find us planning the next revolution against the filthy Random Hall government. We only house fourteen soldiers but the clam lives within many others around the dorm and the MIT campus!

  p we’re best described as “wholesome sketchy.” with at least one bh resident awake at every hour of the day, you can generally find someone in bhitchen (black hole kitchen). they might be cooking, building, climbing, scheming, planning out an elaborate floor event, or even doing *gasp* math! maybe they’ll ask if you want to go climbing or practice spinning arts on the roofdeck.
