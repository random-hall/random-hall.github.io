    h3#article-3-section-2-ss-a Subsection A: General
    p The Random Hall Budget shall be established by Random Hall on a term-by-term basis as described in Article V, Section 8 of the Random Hall Constitution. The Budget shall serve as a guide for the Vice President in disbursement of funds and the Committee Chairmen in spending of funds. No individual or group may be reimbursed for the purchase of an item unless it has been included in the Random Hall Budget or approved for reimbursement through a discretionary fund.
    p The Vice President shall be responsible for collecting and compiling the information needed to create the Budget, including but not limited to budget requests made by Committee Chairman, budget requests made by members of Random Hall for the purchase of capital Items, the amount of money in Random Hall's savings accounts, and the amount of income to be received by Random Hall through the House Tax.
    p An ExecComm budget meeting shall be called within a week before the House Budget Meeting. All members of ExecComm shall attend this meeting. The purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss the budget compiled by the Vice President. Each person who requested money shall explain the purpose of the request, either verbally or by submitting a written explanation to the Vice President in advance of the meeting. The budget compiled by the Vice President may include a budget deficit at the discretion of the Vice President, as long as the total budget does not exceed the balance of the Random Hall main account. If the budget compiled by the Vice President exceeds the balance of the Random Hall main account, changes in the amount of money allocated for various purposes shall be made in a way that is agreeable to all interested parties to eliminate the deficit. ExecComm shall then vote on whether to accept the proposed budget as it stands.
    p Less than 24 hours after the end of the ExecComm budget meeting, the proposed budget shall be distributed to all voting members of Random Hall. At the House Budget Meeting, the Vice President shall briefly go over all of the items in the budget and shall ask for any discussion of or changes to those items before the House votes on whether to approve the budget.
    h#article-3-section-2-ss-b Subsection B: Discretionary Funds
    p Every Random Hall Budget shall include line items for an ExecComm discretionary fund, a President's discretionary fund, and a discretionary fund for each floor.
    p ExecComm may spend the ExecComm discretionary fund at its discretion. Individuals or groups may also request ExecComm discretionary funds for expenses not otherwise included in the budget. Any individual or group requesting ExecComm discretionary funds must make the request of any member of ExecComm. That ExecComm member must inform the other members of ExecComm of the request at any time before the subsequent ExecComm meeting. The request must state both the reason for the request and the amount of money requested. The money shall be allocated from the ExecComm discresionary fund under the following conditions: at a regularly scheduled ExecComm meeting, with a simple majority of ExecComm; at an extraordinary meeting, only if four of the seven voting members of ExecComm vote to approve the allocation.
    p The President's discretionary fund shall serve a purpose similar to the ExecComm discretionary fund. The President may spend the President’s discretionary fund at their discretion, and any person or group may request President’s discretionary funds by making a request of the President. The request must state both the reason for the request and the amount of money requested. The President shall decide whether to allocate the funds within 48 hours of the request. Upon deciding to allocate President's discretionary funds, the President must inform the other members of ExecComm of their decision within 24 hours.
    p Floor discretionary funds are a source of funding for specific types of purchases for a floor. Each floor's discretionary funds may be spent on either capital items or on community consumable items for the use of that floor. Capital items are items that are intended to last for a relatively long time, such as pots and pans, TVs, sound systems, etc. Community consumable items are items that will be used up, which the floor prefers to purchase in large quantities, and which will be available for the use of the floor. This includes baking supplies, spices, aluminum foil, etc.
    p Floors may petition for the ability to spend their floor budget outside of these guidelines. A request should be submitted to the Vice President in advance of the ExecComm budget meeting, and should include the proposed purchase and the amount proposed to be spent. ExecComm shall decide whether or not to approve the petition by majority vote. ExecComm should decide whether to approve the request based on whether the request will benefit the floor. A floor may not petition to extend their floor budget if their budget was extended the previous term.
    p Each floor will decide its method for allocating floor funds (voting, discussion, etc.) at the beginning of each fall semester, and can change the method at any point.

    h2#article-5-section-2 Section 2: Floor Designations 
    h3#article-5-section-2-ss-a Coed and Non-Coed Floors 
    p A floor that wishes to change their designation as coed or non-coed should contact the RACs and request an anonymous vote at any time at least one year since the floor’s last change in designation. A vote of strictly greater than 2/3 of all current undergraduate floor residents will change the floor's designation. A floor may not change to a designation that is not satisfied by at least 2/3 of its current undergraduate population. After a floor changes its designation, the change takes effect the next time a resident moves onto that floor. The floor’s new designation will apply only to residents moving onto the floor subsequent to the change in designation. Current residents of a floor may continue to live in their current rooms or move to different rooms on the same floor even if they do not satisfy the floor’s new designation, so long as they have not moved to a different floor in Random Hall in the meantime.
    p The RACs will ensure that the gender constraints of all non-coed floors are maintained, subject to the rules of the MIT Housing Office.
    h3#article-5-section-1-ss-b Cat Floors 
    p A floor that wishes to become a cat floor or cease being a cat floor should contact the RACs and ExecComm, who should determine the applicable MIT policies regarding cats and act in accordance with them.
    h3#article-5-section-1-ss-c Top-optional Floors 
    p A floor that wishes to be top-optional should contact the Random Hall Area Director and Heads of House (radhoh@mit.edu) at the beginning of a semester and request an anonymous vote. A unanimous vote in favor of being top-optional will give the floor this designation until the end of the term in which the vote was held.
    h3#article-5-section-1-ss-c Current Designations 
    p The current designations of each floor are: 
    ul
      li Destiny: coed; 
      li Loop: non-coed (female and non-binary), cat floor; 
      li Clam: coed, top-optional (FA25); 
      li Bonfire: coed; 
      li Foo: coed; 
      li Black Hole: coed, cat floor, top-optional (FA25); 
      li BMF: coed;
      li Pecker: coed, top-optional (FA25).
    h2#article-5-section-3 Section 3: Room Assignments 
    p The RACs are in charge of room assignments for all undergraduate residents of Random Hall. The RACs will maintain a list of current room assignments accessible to all Random Hall residents. Room assignments must be approved by the MIT Housing Office and the MIT Housing Office has the right to change room assignments at its discretion.
    p At the end of the Fall and Spring terms, the RACs will initiate a period of room switching during which room assignments will be adjusted according to the procedures set forth in §§4-6. At the beginning of each Fall semester, room assignments for freshmen only will be made according to the procedures set forth in §7. Room assignments may also change at other times under certain circumstances, as described in §8.
    p The RACs have final authority in making any and all decisions with regards to room assignments in Random Hall. Any decision made by the RACs may be appealed to the Random Hall Judicial Committee for arbitration.
    h2#article-5-section-4 Section 4: Priority 
    h3#article-5-section-4-ss-a Priority List 
    p The RACs will maintain a list of all Random Hall residents in order of priority (hereafter referred to as the "priority list"), accessible to all Random Hall residents. Any moves between rooms in Random Hall will be resolved in order of decreasing priority (i.e. if more than one resident wishes to move into a vacant or imminently vacant room, the resident with the highest priority gets it), except in the case of pull-ins (c.f. §4.5) or moving from one half of a divided double to the other (c.f. §4.6).
    p The priority list is divided into contiguous sublists according to class year. Older classes have higher priority than younger classes. Class year for these purposes is determined by the year in which a resident first enrolled in MIT as an undergraduate, subject to RACs discretion in cases where the resident is visiting or transferring from another institution, or is returning to MIT from a leave of absence.
    h3#article-5-section-4-ss-b Using priority 
    p A resident will "use priority" whenever they move into a new room, except in the following cases: the move is part of a room swap, or the move is part of an emergency move in accordance with §8.
    p At the end of each period of room switching, the RACs will adjust the priority list by removing all residents who have used their priority during that period of room switching and re-adding them to the end of their respective class year sublists in reverse order of their original priority.
    p A resident who is displaced from their current room assignment may have their priority adjusted at the RACs discretion.
    h3#article-5-section-4-ss-c Priority for newly-assigned residents 
    p When a new resident is assigned to Random Hall, any currently active period of room switching (including priority adjustments as per §4.2) will first be resolved for current residents. Afterwards, any newly assigned residents in need of a room assignment will be added to the end of their class year’s priority list (in random order within each class year). There will then be a separate period of room switching during which the new residents will choose their rooms. Once the new residents have chosen rooms, their priorities will be adjusted as per §4.2.
    h3#article-5-section-4-ss-d Squatting 
    p Any resident of Random who has moved into their assigned room has the right to "squat", i.e. keep their current room assignment during any period of room switching. 
    p Under certain emergency circumstances and as required by the MIT Housing Office, a resident may be required to change rooms despite their right to squat.
    h3#article-5-section-4-ss-e Pull-ins to doubles and divided doubles 
    p A resident who is assigned to a double or divided double following a period of room switching may "pull in" another resident as their roommate whenever the other spot in that room is available. The resident being pulled in must agree to be pulled in. A resident who is pulled into a room will get the spot regardless of priority. A resident who moves due to a pull-in still uses priority unless the move satisfies one of the exceptions listed in §4.2. On a non-coed floor, only residents that satisfy the floor's gender constraint may be pulled into rooms on that floor.
    h3#article-5-section-4-ss-f Moving between halves of a divided double 
    p Whenever one half of a divided double becomes available, the resident of the other half has the right to move to the vacated half before it is made available to other residents (even those with higher priority). A resident who moves from one half of a divided double to the other in this way uses priority.
    h2#article-5-section-5 Section 5: Room Reassignments Between Semesters 
    h3#article-5-section-5-ss-a End of Fall term 
    p There will be a period of room switching near the end of each Fall semester. The RACs will email all current residents with the list of rooms expected to be vacated at the end of the Fall term and a deadline by which to indicate interest in any of the available rooms. After the initial round of room reassignments is resolved, the list of newly vacated rooms will be emailed out and subject to the same procedure. This will continue iteratively until no more current residents express interest in moving into the available rooms. Any pull-ins will be resolved as they arise. The priority list will be readjusted as per §4.2 at the end of this period of room switching. Afterwards, newly assigned residents (if any) will choose from among the available rooms in a second period of room switching.
    p The residents who will be moving as a result of the room switches will move during IAP, as directed by the MIT Housing Office. The MIT Housing Office may require residents who are moving out of Random Hall at the end of IAP to move to a temporary room during IAP.
    h3#article-5-section-5-ss-b End of Spring term 
    p There will be a period of room switching near the end of each Spring semester. The RACs will email out a list of residents expected to return to Random Hall for the next school year. Using an online or paper form, each returning resident will indicate whether they wish to squat in their current room assignment or whether they wish to move to a different room for the next school year. A resident wishing to move to a different room will list the rooms they would like to move to, in order of preference, ending with their current room. For each double or divided double that a resident expresses a preference for (or is squatting in), the resident may also provide a list of other residents they would like to pull in (in order of preference) should they be placed in that room. Residents may also express other preferences that may or may not be honored by the RACs.
    p Conditional requests of the following forms will be honored whenever possible: "This room is my n-th preference only if I can pull in person A (or person B, or person C, etc.) as my roommate. If not, then this room is my m-th preference." "This room is my n-th preference only if I can be pulled in by person A (or person B, or person C, etc.). If not, then this room is my m-th preference." "This room is my n-th preference only if my roommate is person A (or person B, or person C, etc.). If not, then this room is my m-th preference." "I do not want to live in the same room as person A."
    p Requests of the following form will be honored whenever possible if the Random Hall Judicial Committee deems it necessary due to a dispute between the residents involved: "I do not want to live on the same floor as person A."
    p Any other requests conditional on any other resident’s housing preferences will be ignored.
    p The RACs will ensure that all returning residents (including those who wish to squat) submit a completed preference form by the specified deadline.
    p Residents who have applied for 9th or 10th term housing for the following Fall semester will also complete a preference form. The RACs will resolve the preferences of such residents as if they were returning to Random Hall in the Fall. (However, as required by the MIT Housing Office, they will not officially be given room assignments for the Fall semester.) If the residents are subsequently denied 9th or 10th term housing, adjustments to the other residents’ room assignments will be made during the summer when this becomes apparent.
    p The RACs will first assign all residents who choose to squat to their current rooms. If any residents have listed the rooms being squatted in among their preferences, those preferences will be removed from consideration. If any residents have only their current room remaining as a valid choice, they will be placed in that room and the room will be removed from everyone else's preference lists. This will be repeated until no residents can be assigned in this manner. In order of highest to lowest priority, each remaining resident will be tentatively assigned to their highest-ranked room that has not yet been assigned. Each room that is tentatively assigned will be tentatively removed from everyone else's preference lists. If the tentatively assigned room ends up not being vacated by its current resident, then the tentative assignment will be reversed and that room will be removed from consideration for the resident who was tentatively assigned to it. This process will be repeated until there is a stable assignment of all residents to rooms. Any pull-in requests will be resolved as they arise.
    p No resident will be assigned to a room they prefer less than their current room. No resident of a divided double whose roommate moves out of that room will be assigned to a room they prefer less than their preferred half of their current divided double. No resident will be pulled into a room they prefer less than any room they would otherwise have gotten.
    p The priority list will be readjusted as per §4.2 at the end of this period of room switching. Afterwards, newly assigned residents (if any) will choose from among the available rooms in a second period of room switching.
    h2#article-5-section-6 Section 6: Room Reassignments at Other Times 
    h3#article-5-section-6-ss-a Vacancies during the summer 
    p If any vacancies arise due to one or many residents switching to a different dorm or canceling their housing during the summer, the RACs will retroactively adjust the results of the previous period of room switching using the preferences collected at the end of the last Spring term.
    h3#article-5-section-6-ss-b 9th or 10th term seniors denied housing 
    p During the summer, if it becomes clear that residents who have applied for 9th or 10th term housing will not be granted housing (e.g. if new residents are assigned to Random such that there are not enough spots left for the prospective 9th or 10th term residents), the RACs will retroactively adjust the results of the previous period of room switching using the preferences collected at the end of the last Spring term.
    h3#article-5-section-6-ss-c New residents assigned after freshman temporary assignments have been made 
    p As required by the MIT Housing Office, freshmen’s temporary room assignments cannot be changed after they are made. If there are new residents assigned to Random Hall after freshman temporary assignments have been made, these new residents will be given temporary rooms (which they can squat in if they so desire) to stay in until the freshman room selection process, described in §7. If they so desire, these new residents can choose new rooms (in order of priority) from among the vacant rooms and rooms temporarily occupied by freshmen or new residents in a special period of room switching preceding the freshman room selection process. Any pull-ins will be resolved as they arise. The priority list will be readjusted as per §4.2 at the end of this period of room switching.
    h2#article-5-section-7 Section 7: Freshman Room Assignments 
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-a Temporary Freshman Room Assignments 
    p Before each Fall term, the freshmen assigned to Random Hall in the Freshman Summer Housing Lottery will be assigned temporary rooms at the discretion of the RACs, based on their responses to the MIT Housing questionnaire and a separate questionnaire administered by the RACs over the summer. Two freshmen of different gender may be assigned to the same temporary room (i.e. a co-ed double) so long as their preferences for roommate gender match. 
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-b Communication 
    p A variety of information will be made available to freshmen both over the summer and when they arrive in Random. An email during the summer (sent to all freshmen currently assigned to Random) will fully explain the rooming process, emphasize that the summer room assignments are temporary ones, and provide contact information for the relevant people (RACs, President, Heads of House, and Area Director). Flyers containing similar information, as well as important dates and an invitation to speak with someone (RACs, President, Heads of House, or Area Director) if there is a problem, will be given to all freshmen when they check in. These flyers will also be available at desk for any potential FYREs or parents who are looking for information. Any potential FYRE should be directed to contact the RACs so they can be added to a mailing list that will receive relevant emails about upcoming events or opportunities to ask questions about the rooming process.
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-c Freshman Room Selection Process and Floor Exploration 
    p On the evening designated by MIT Housing, following the announcement of First Year Residence Exchange (FYRE) results, the freshmen assigned to Random Hall will assemble and the RACs will hold a brief informational meeting to explain the room assignment procedures and the rooms available to the freshmen. Following this meeting, the freshmen will be taken on a tour of the dorm to see all of the floors and to see the available types of rooms. There will be a period of at least 60 minutes during which freshmen may visit floors at will ("floor exploration"). During floor exploration, the RACs will be available to meet privately with freshmen who may have special circumstances. Freshmen will then meet back in Foo to fill out the Rooming Preferences Form, on which they will give numerical rankings to rooms. The form will be due no less than one hour after distribution by the RACs and the end of floor exploration. After the forms have all been submitted, the RACs will use an algorithm to place freshmen based on their preferences, optimizing for the greatest number of freshmen in their top choice rooms. Some impersonal changes (fixing errors in the algorithm output, correcting for special circumstances, preserving gender balance, adjusting for cat allergies, etc.) may need to be made by hand by the RACs, but these changes and their justification will be available to the Area Director. Final room assignments will be emailed to freshmen as soon as they are available, 7 a.m. the following day at the latest.
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-d Freshman Priorities 
    p After final assignments have been determined, the RACs will create the freshman priority list, to be used for any moves students make throughout their time in Random. Those who received their lowest choice rooms will have higher priority and those who received their highest choice rooms will have lower priority. Within a group of freshmen who got their same choice room (ex. if 5 freshmen got their second choice room), those freshmen will be placed on the priority list in a randomized order. For purposes of priority, freshmen who get pulled in to a small half or double, or who are placed in a room outside of the typical rooming process, will be considered to have received "better" than their first choice room (as they received the added benefit of having a guaranteed room assignment), and will be ranked lowest in priority.
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-e Pull-ins of freshmen by upperclassmen 
    p Upperclassmen who wish to pull in a freshman must contact (in-person or by email) the RACs with the name of the freshman they wish to pull-in before the time at which the ranking form must be submitted. The freshman being pulled in must agree to be pulled in and must also contact the RACs.
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-f Freshmen with special circumstances 
    p Students who may have a problem with this process for any reason (including but not limited to health concerns, cat allergies, religious reasons, mental health concerns, undue stress, or problems with another student) should contact the room assignment chairs (RACs), who, together with the student, will figure out the best solution. If the student would feel more comfortable talking to the President, Area Director, or Heads of House instead, they can do so, though the RACs will need to be informed if any accommodations are to be made. The solution may be as simple as a conversation to resolve any confusion, or may involve making special considerations during the room assignment process, or, in certain cases, allowing the first-year to bypass the process entirely and remain in their temporary room.
    p The above paragraph will be included in the information given to the students both over the summer and when they arrive, along with contact information for the RACs, President, Area Director, and Heads of House.
    h3#article-5-section-7-ss-g Move Day and Floor Welcoming 
    p Prior to floor exploration, the President will call for upperclassmen volunteers to help freshmen move their belongings from their temporary room to their fall assignment. Moving will happen the morning after room assignments are sent out. Floors will be responsible for welcoming new residents and are highly encouraged to hold floor meetings at the beginning of the semester.
    h2#article-5-section-8 Section 8: Special Circumstances and Emergency Moves 
    p In the case that a resident assigned to Random Hall has special circumstances (including but not limited to medical, religious, or personal circumstances) limiting the rooms in which that resident can live, or in the case that a current resident encounters a special circumstance which makes them temporarily or permanently unable to live in their current room assignment, the RACs will facilitate an emergency move. The resident will contact the RACs (either directly or through the MIT Housing Office, Head of House, AD, a GRA, or a member of the Judicial Committee) to explain their special circumstance and the RACs will make every effort to ensure that a suitable room can be made available to the resident. If no suitable room is currently available, the RACs will contact the current occupants of any rooms suitable for the resident with a special circumstance and ask for volunteers to swap rooms with the resident. If there are no volunteers, the resident of such a suitable room with the lowest priority will be asked to swap rooms with the resident with a special circumstance. No resident may be involuntarily displaced from their room more than once during their tenure at Random Hall. In either case, the displaced resident will be compensated with an increase in priority for the duration of the swap, subject to the discretion of the RACs, and will be guaranteed to be able to return to the room from which they were displaced (if they so desire) when it next becomes available again.
    h1#article-6 Article VI: Changes to Bylaws 
    p Changes, additions, or deletions to Article III or Article IV, Sections 1 and 2 of the Random Hall Bylaws shall be made by four of the seven voting members of ExecComm voting in favor of the change at an ExecComm meeting.
    p Changes, additions, or deletions to any Subsection of Sections 3 or 4 of Article IV of the Random Hall Bylaws shall be made by the holder of the chairmanship or appointments described by that Subsection of the Bylaws, subject to the approval of ExecComm. ExecComm may propose changes to any of these Subsections to the appropriate chairman or appointee, who then may approve or reject these changes.
    p Changes, additions, or deletions to Article V of the Random Hall Bylaws shall be made by an RAC, subject to the approval of ExecComm.
    p Changes, additions, or deletions to Articles I, II, IV Section 5, or VI of the Random Hall Bylaws shall be made by a majority vote at a House Meeting.
    h1#article-7 Article VII: Ratification 
    p These bylaws shall be adopted by a majority vote of ExecComm. This document shall supersede all previous versions of the Random Hall Bylaws.
