  h2.section-header Executive Committee
  p Random is ruled by the Executive Committee, lovingly known as ExecComm. (Most of Random's governing structures have 'Comm' in their names because none of us can spell comiteee.)
  p Our government is far from oppressive and is very open to input from everyone. Many freshmen are elected to positions in their first term.
  p The President, Vice President, and Secretary are elected in December. Members at Large are elected in February.

  h2.section-header Judicial Committee
  p JudComm is the judiciary branch of our dorm government. Its members provide arbitration in disputes and enforce dorm rules (of which there are very few). Most dorm problems can be handled internally, generally without even involving JudComm.
