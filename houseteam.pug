  h2.section-header Heads of House
  p The Heads of House are working members of the MIT community who live with us, offer advice and counseling, sponsor dorm events, and are a liason to the Deans, MIT Health, the faculty, and the administration. Random’s Heads of House care deeply about students' mental and physical health, and they’re here to support Randomites during tough times as well as share in the happy moments. You can stop by their apartment on the first floor anytime to chat about what's going on in your life - both inside and outside of MIT - or just grab some candy!

  h2.section-header GRAs
  p Random's three friendly Graduate Resident Advisors are neither academic advisors (though they, like our other residents, will usually help with academics if asked) nor rule-enforcers. They do add sanity and something resembling an adult presence to the floors. Often seen as "big brothers," (in the friendly sibling sense, not the Orwellian sense) they are there to talk to when you need it.

  hd.section-header House Operations Manager 
  p The House Operations Manager is there for Random to keep the building clean and well-maintained. They oversee cleaning, maintenance, repairs, and can act as a liason to MIT Facilities. If you have any issues with the building and its facilities, the HOM is a good person to contact.

  h2.section-header Area Director
  p The Area Director supports Random&#x2019;s Heads of House and the GRAs to help foster supportive and inclusive community within the Hall. Along side the Heads of house, they can be an advocate and liaison within MIT and encourage success outside in your personal and professional life. Their office is behind the Front Desk in Foo and are available by phone, text, email, and designated office hours! In addition to providing monthly study breaks open to the entire Hall, the Area Director helps support the community through individual and group coaching, advising, administrative processing, and advocacy. If you have any issues, concerns or you just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
